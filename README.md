This project is a clone of the popular puzzle game [Sokoban](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban).  
It consists of a `core` library written in Kotlin and a [fritz2](https://fritz2.dev) based web app.  
Additionally, a legacy version based on Java and Swing is included for the nostalgia ðŸ¦–

The latest web version can be played [here](https://sokoban.haukesomm.de).
